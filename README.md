A starter project exploring the basics of React Native

## Created By Daniel Burbach

## __Sections:__

### __Lists__
Built using React Hooks. Initial use of header, color use, and StyleSheets. Generation of list using map. Deletion of secondary list on click with use of a handler.

### __Flexbox__
A React-Native experimentation of Flexbox in React Native with StyleSheets layout.

### __Color Gradient__
React-Native Animated gradient changer using an [online tutorial](https://medium.com/@GroundControl/animating-gradients-in-react-native-8853dbd97d02). Utilizing expo-linear-gradient and record the previous gradient as well as the current list of gradients to allow for smooth transition, and a const called tweener to incorporate new Animated Values. 

Further examples also may incorprate start and endpoint animations of gradients.

### __API Call__
Using [Fetch API](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network) and another [online tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yJu_4RkaIc). This gathers set API data, uses a false authentication for example purposes, and maps a list of generated data in React Native.

### __Todo List__
Built using React Hooks. This sets to state entered data (using a random.Math generated key id), displays set data in an ordered map list, and allows the user to delete entered (and button approved) list item on touch of item.

### __Technologies Used__

  React-Native, React, expo, jest, expo-linear-gradient, and react-native-gesture-handler.

### __Version__
